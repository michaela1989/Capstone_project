##The Effects of Induced Affect on Word Recall
###By Michaela

##Introduction
This study was conducted in an attempt to broadly delineate the effects of affect on recall as well as take into account the influence of arousal levels.  It was hypothesized that the effects of induced positive affect would improve recollection of neutrally valenced words whereas induced negative affect would deleteriously affect recollection.  In addition, higher arousal levels, irrespective of the valence of induced affect, would improve recollection.  Therefore, induced positive affect, in combination with high levels of arousal, should demonstrate the largest improvement in recall, whereas induced negative affect, in combination with low levels of arousal, should demonstrate the largest deficit in recollection.  Previous researchers that have utilized affect induction via film in the service of memory studies often attempted to measure several items, wherein researchers measured how much participants recalled film and contextual detail as well as words presented as the clip was shown.  In such complex experiments, there is always the risk that the attempt to measure so many factors may confound or confuse the results.  This study sought to avoid those concerns through a singular focus on word-recall, with the content of the film used for affect induction only.
